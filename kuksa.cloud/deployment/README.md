# Kuksa Cloud Deployment

The scripts in this directory and it's subdirectories help to setup a deployment of the Kuksa cloud. These scripts
assume a running Kubernetes cluster which can be configured using `kubectl`. More information regarding the parameters
of the scripts can be found within the respective script file.

## Overall structure

The scripts have been written to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster on Microsoft Azure. They might be modified to deploy
to other Kubernetes services.

The deployment scripts are divided into the following groups:

### Infrastructure

These services are required to make the other services work

  1. [Azure](azure/README.md) for Azure-specific configuration that provides the basis of Kubernetes. It includes
     cert-manager that obtains TLS certificates.
### Services

  1. Eclipse Hono adds a messaging infrastructure to accept incoming messages over a number of protocols like MQTT or HTTP. 
  1. [Eclipse hawkBit](eclipse-hawkbit/README.md) enables the deployment of the corresponding software update
     components, in particular the update server
  1. [Kuksa Appstore](../kuksa-appstore/README.md) has to be
     [built](eclipse-kuksa/utils/README.md#build-eclipse-kuksa-appstore) before is can be
     [deployed](eclipse-kuksa/utils/README.md#deploy-eclipse-kuksa-appstore)
  1. [Hono-Influxdb-Connector](../utils/hono-influxdb-connector/README.md) sends Hono telemetry data and events to
     InfluxDB.
  1. [MIL example](../examples/malfunction-indicator-light/README.md) an exemplary malfunction-indicator-light use case
