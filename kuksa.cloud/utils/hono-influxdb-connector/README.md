# Hono-InfluxDB-Connector

This project contains a Spring-Boot Application that connects a running Hono instance with a running InfluxDB instance
so that messages received by Hono can be stored in InfluxDB. This is especially useful if one wants
to easily create a visualization of some measurements eg with Grafana.

## Build 

To build the Hono-InfluxDB-Connector navigate to its directory.

`cd utils/hono-influxdb-connector`

Build the project using `gradle build`. (The build has been tested with [Gradle v5.0](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/releases/tag/v5.0.0)).

To create a Docker image and push the image to a Docker registry, run

```bash
./pushImage.sh \
    <Hostname of the Docker registry> \
    <Username to log into the Docker registry> \
    <Password to log into the Docker registry>
```

## Deployment

To deploy in a Kubernetes cluster:

* Download the Hono demo certificates [trusted-certs.pem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse/hono/master/demo-certs/certs/trusted-certs.pem)
  (or any other certificates that you use for Hono) to `deployment/eclipse-kuksa/utils/hono-influxdb-connector`
* run in `deployment/eclipse-kuksa/utils/hono-influxdb-connector`

```bash
./deploy_connector.sh \
    <Cluster-internal URL of InfluxDB, typically http://influxdb.hono:8086> \
    <Cluster-internal hostname of QPID dispatch router, typically hono-dispatch-router-ext.hono> \
    <Cluster-internal port of QPID dispatch router, typically 5671> \
    <Hono user, typically consumer@HONO> \
    <Password of Hono user> \
    <Path to truststore with Hono certificates, typically ./trusted-certs.pem> \
    <Whether or not to verify the hostname for TLS connection to Hono, should be true> \
    <Connections between Hono and InfluxDB, e.g. DEFAULT_TENANT:devices,otherTenant:nameOfOtherInfluxDatabase> \
    <Name of the Kubernetes secret to store the Docker registry credentials in> \
    <Hostname of the Docker registry> \
    <Username to log into the Docker registry> \
    <Password to log into the Docker registry>
```

## Configuration

To configure the connector either edit the [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) file or set the respective environment variables.
If an environment variable is set it will overwrite the .properties value.
The table below lists all configuration parameter available.
