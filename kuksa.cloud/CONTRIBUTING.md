# Contributing to Eclipse Kuksa

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Because today's software-intensive automotive systems are still developed in
silos by each car manufacturer or OEM in-house, long-term challenges in the
industry are yet unresolved. Establishing a standard for car-to-cloud scenarios
significantly improves comprehensive domain-related development activities and
opens the market to external applications, service provider, and the use of open
source software wherever possible without compromising security. Connectivity,
OTA maintenance, automated driving, electric mobility, and related approaches
increasingly demand technical innovations applicable across automotive players.
